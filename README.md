EventBus
========

EventBus is a JS library, that promotes a loosely coupled communication between the objects. 
It is implemented in a BDD methodology, hence specs are also available for helping see how 
this EventBus simplifies the maintainability "nightmare".

A quick demo is also available; the demo is about registering some events for particular UI components
and then fireEvent() will trigger the actions registered.

You can take the EventBus.js, and plug-in into your context, without any dependencies, it's just plain javascript.

The specs help for a better understanding of how this small library works, and also deliver a guarantee about
the actual implementation.
